                                    In short, we recommend getting creative within your means. To test your solution with users, it is always best to meet them face-to-face. This allows you to ask for real-time feedback, see upfront how they use your application, and pick up on subtle reactions. However, that is not possible, so we recommend getting creative in finding solutions as close to that as possible. Here are some potential solutions: <br><br>

                                    1) Conduct the interview over a video call. <br>
                                    2) Conduct the interview over a phone call, asking the potential user to constantly speak their thoughts out loud, so you can pick up on all of their feedback. <br>
                                    3) Write up a series of questions and ask your potential user to record themselves as they answer the questions and use your solution. <br>
                                    4) Simply ask for written feedback from your users.

                                    Our judges will surely be mindful of the limitations that have been added by COVID-19. This includes but is not limited to: <br><br>

1) Ability to meet as a team <br>
2) Ability to have users test the solution <br>
3) Lack of internet access or proper developer environments due to displacement from your college campus.
